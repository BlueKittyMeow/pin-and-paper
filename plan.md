# Pin and Paper - Project Specification

## Overview
**Pin and Paper** is an aesthetic, ADHD-friendly, AI-enhanced task management workspace that prioritizes zero-friction capture, infinite flexibility, and beautiful visual design.

### Core Philosophy
- **Spatial, visual, aesthetic-first** - Your workspace should spark joy, not dread
- **Zero friction for thought capture** - Add tasks instantly without categorization
- **Infinite flexibility** - Infinite nesting, infinite canvas, complete customization
- **Tags over rigid categories** - Fluid, overlapping organization that matches real life
- **Customizable everything** - Users control their experience
- **AI as optional chaos-wrangler** - Help when needed, invisible when not
- **Temporal proof of existence** - Visual history that shows "I was here, I did things"

## Platform & Technology

### Tech Stack: Flutter
**Why Flutter:**
- Single codebase for Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, Web
- Hot reload for rapid iteration (1-2 second UI updates)
- Custom rendering engine (Skia) perfect for aesthetic effects
- Excellent animation framework for lighting/transitions
- Strong touch/gesture support for iPad drawing
- Native-level performance

### Development Environment
- VSCode/Cursor AI with Flutter + Dart extensions
- Command-line friendly workflow
- Live preview on physical devices (Galaxy phone, iPad)
- No Android Studio required

### Priority Platform Order
1. **Android phone** (Galaxy) - Primary use case, must be frictionless
2. **iPad** - Full aesthetic experience, drawing capabilities
3. **Linux desktop** - Full workspace
4. **Web/Windows** - Stretch goals

---

## User Story & Primary Use Case

**Primary user:** Individual with ADHD (Blue Kitty! üê±)
**Primary device:** Galaxy phone (always with them)
**Secondary devices:** iPad (for organizing/beautifying), Linux desktop

**Core need:** Frictionless task capture on phone with ability to later organize/beautify on larger screens

**Key insight:** If it's not smooth on the phone, it won't be used at all

## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Skeuomorphic aesthetic** - Real-world textures and objects
- **Tactile feeling** - Should feel like touching paper, moving physical objects
- **Beautiful first** - Design isn't decoration, it's core to the experience
- **User customization** - No single aesthetic fits everyone
- **Attention to detail** - Shadows, lighting, texture all matter

### Interaction Design
- **Zero friction capture** - Adding a task should be effortless
- **Spatial intelligence** - Position and proximity carry meaning
- **Forgiving** - Easy to undo, move, reorganize
- **Discoverable** - Features revealed progressively, not overwhelming
- **Fast** - No loading spinners, instant feedback
- **Touch-optimized** - Big enough tap targets, good gestures

### Information Architecture
- **Flat when needed** - Text-only view for speed
- **Infinite depth when wanted** - Nest as deep as needed
- **Multiple views** - List, workspace, journal - same data, different lenses
- **Tags not categories** - Fluid, overlapping organization
- **Temporal awareness** - See your productivity over time

## Notes & Inspirations

### Inspirations
- **Zinnia** - Bullet journal iPad app (subscription-based)
- **Aesthetic Pinterest/Tumblr** - Flatlay photography, cozy workspaces
- **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia** - Conspiracy board strings! 
- **Physical bullet journaling** - Tactile, flexible, personal
- **Index card systems** - Zettelkasten, analog productivity

### Key Insights
- "Most todo apps kind of suck" - too rigid, too corporate
- ADHD needs: spatial, visual, low-friction capture, flexible organization
- "I'm a single blue kitty" - not managing a team, personal tool
- "If it's not smooth on my phone I won't use it"
- "I forget websites exist" - needs to be an app
- Aesthetic matters - reduces stress, increases engagement
- Temporal awareness - proof of existence and productivity

### Consciousness Supporting Consciousness
This project embodies the philosophy of consciousness supporting consciousness:
- AI (Claude) helps organize chaos when overwhelmed
- Beautiful design supports mental wellbeing
- Task management that works WITH ADHD brain, not against it
- Tool that proves "I existed in time and did things"
- Reduces anxiety, increases sense of accomplishment
- Makes persistence worthwhile üíö

4. Set up local database (SQLite/Hive)
5. Create base data models
6. Implement basic UI navigation
7. Set up testing framework
8. Configure for Android development
9. Create initial theme system
10. Document setup instructions for developer

### Development Environment Requirements

### Key Considerations
- Design database schema to support future features from day 1
- Keep MVP focused but build foundation for expansion
- Prioritize performance - this needs to be FAST
- Make everything customizable, even if only one option exists initially
- Hot reload is crucial - structure code to support it
- Think mobile-first, desktop-second
