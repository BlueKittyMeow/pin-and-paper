---

## Next Steps

### If Issues Remain (Create v[N+1])

**Trigger:** Fixes applied, need verification

**Process:**
1. Claude applies fixes from this version
2. Create new file: `phase-X.Y-validation-v[N+1].md`
3. Reference this version in "Previous Version" field
4. List issues from this version to verify
5. Team reviews and adds new findings

**Example:**
If this is v1 with issues ‚Üí create v2 after fixes applied

---

### If Validation Complete (Mark FINAL)

**Criteria:**
- [ ] All CRITICAL issues resolved
- [ ] All HIGH issues resolved or deferred
- [ ] Build passes (flutter analyze, test, build)
- [ ] Team signs off

**Action:**
1. Update header: `**Status:** ‚úÖ FINAL - Phase [X.Y] VALIDATED`
2. Complete sign-off section below
3. No v[N+1] needed - validation closed
