# Group 1 (Phase 3.1-3.3) Secondary Feedback

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** Ready for team review (Round 2)
**Previous Round:** `group1-prelim-feedback.md` (13 issues - all addressed)

---

## Context

This is the **second round** of review for the Group 1 implementation plan (`group1.md`). The first round identified 13 issues (9 major, 4 medium), all of which have been addressed. See `group1-feedback-responses.md` for the complete list of fixes applied.

**Changes Since Last Review:**
1. Fixed `_parseAbsoluteDate` with substring detection and year normalization
2. Added clock mocking strategy (`clock` package for testable time-dependent code)
3. Added DateParserService performance optimization note (service-level caching)
4. Clarified documentation discrepancies (due_date column history, live parsing UI scope)
5. Verified 9/13 issues were already correctly implemented in original plan

**New Architectural Decisions:**
- Brain Dump date parsing architecture finalized (Option 2: Claude extracts phrases, local parses)
- UI element terminology clarified (`docs/ui-element-terminology.md`)
- Quick Add Field date parsing toggle approved (default: ON)

## Review Instructions

Please review the updated `group1.md` file with focus on:

1. **Completeness:** Are all implementation details sufficient for Phase 3.1-3.3?
2. **Correctness:** Are the code examples, SQL queries, and logic sound?
3. **Clarity:** Is the plan easy to follow for implementation?
4. **Consistency:** Does everything align with architectural decisions?
5. **Testing:** Are test strategies comprehensive enough?

**Out of Scope for This Review:**
- Phase 3.4-3.5 details (Group 2 planning)
- UI/UX design specifics (focus on logic and data flow)
- Performance optimization beyond what's documented
