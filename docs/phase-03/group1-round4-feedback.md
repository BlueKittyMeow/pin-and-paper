## Context

This is **Round 4** review of the Group 1 implementation plan (`group1.md`) after all Round 3 fixes have been applied. This review verifies that the fixes were implemented correctly and introduces no new issues.

**Changes Since Round 3 (All 7 Issues Fixed):**

1. **CRITICAL - _createDB Schema:** Completely replaced to match `_migrateToV4` exactly
   - task_images: 10 columns (file_path not image_path, added 6 columns)
   - entities: 5 columns (type not entity_type, added display_name & notes)
   - tags: Added color column
   - Junction tables: Added created_at columns
   - Indexes: 12 total with partial indexes (WHERE clauses)

2. **CRITICAL - TreeController Integration:** Added complete TreeController to TaskProvider
   - Import, field, constructor, helpers added
   - loadTasks refreshes TreeController roots
   - onNodeAccepted handler with copyWith() to preserve ALL fields
   - toggleCollapse delegates to TreeController

3. **HIGH - Legacy Code Removal:** Deleted all flat-list reordering code
   - TaskProvider.reorderTasks removed (REGRESSION)
   - TaskService.reorderTasks removed

4. **HIGH - Visibility Consolidation:** TreeController is single source of truth
   - _collapsedTaskIds Set removed
   - Both HomeScreen modes use AnimatedTreeView
   - Use entry.isExpanded instead of Set checks

5. **MEDIUM - TaskItem Signature:** Fixed signature conflicts
   - depth explicit parameter
   - isExpanded (renamed from isCollapsed)
   - decoration parameter added
   - Icon logic updated

**Team Feedback from Round 3.5:**
- Codex's copyWith fix applied (prevents field stripping)
- Codex's TreeController expansion fix applied (collapse/expand works)
- Gemini's UX enhancement note added (SnackBar TODO)

**Documents Being Reviewed:**
- `docs/phase-03/group1.md` - Updated implementation plan with all fixes applied
- `docs/phase-03/tree-drag-drop-integration-plan.md` - Tree drag-and-drop details (if needed)

**Commit with fixes:** `3a7c09f`

## Review Instructions

Please review `group1.md` with focus on:

1. **Fix Verification:** Were all 7 Round 3 issues fixed correctly?
2. **No Regressions:** Did the fixes introduce any new issues?
3. **Completeness:** Are all implementation details still sufficient?
4. **Correctness:** Are the code examples, SQL queries, and logic sound?
5. **Consistency:** Does everything still align with architectural decisions?
6. **Ready for Implementation:** Is the plan ready to start coding?

**Specific Areas to Check:**
- _createDB schema matches _migrateToV4 (lines 790-1028)
- TaskProvider has complete TreeController integration (lines 1790-1978)
- No legacy reorderTasks methods remain
- HomeScreen uses AnimatedTreeView in both modes (lines 2038-2071)
- TaskItem signature matches usage (lines 2105-2123)

**Out of Scope for This Review:**
- Phase 3.4-3.5 details (Group 2 planning)
- New features not in Phase 3.1-3.3
- Implementation of the plan (reviewing the plan, not the code)
