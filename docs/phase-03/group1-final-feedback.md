## Context

This is the **final round** of review for the Group 1 implementation plan (`group1.md`) before implementation begins. The previous two rounds identified and fixed 20 total issues (13 in Round 1, 7 in Round 2).

**Changes Since Last Review (Round 2):**
1. **CRITICAL:** Removed `depth` from `Task.toMap()` - computed field, not persisted
2. **CRITICAL:** Added complete `_createDB` implementation for fresh installs
3. **HIGH:** Replaced ReorderableListView with flutter_fancy_tree_view2 approach
4. **HIGH:** Fixed tree drag-drop sample compile errors in integration plan
5. **HIGH:** Optimized TaskProvider with in-memory updates (no DB round-trips)
6. **MEDIUM:** Added Value<T> wrapper to UserSettings.copyWith (enable clearing nulls)
7. **MEDIUM:** Replaced DateTime.now() with clock.now() everywhere (testability)

**Documents Being Reviewed:**
- `docs/phase-03/group1.md` - Complete Phase 3.1-3.3 implementation plan
- `docs/phase-03/tree-drag-drop-integration-plan.md` - Tree drag-and-drop fix details

## Review Instructions

Please review both documents with focus on:

1. **Completeness:** Are all implementation details sufficient for Phase 3.1-3.3?
2. **Correctness:** Are the code examples, SQL queries, and logic sound?
3. **Clarity:** Is the plan easy to follow for implementation?
4. **Consistency:** Does everything align with architectural decisions?
5. **Testing:** Are test strategies comprehensive enough?
6. **No Regressions:** Were all Round 1 and Round 2 fixes applied correctly?

**Out of Scope for This Review:**
- Phase 3.4-3.5 details (Group 2 planning - separate review later)
- UI/UX design specifics (focus on logic and data flow)
- Performance optimization beyond what's documented
- Features not explicitly mentioned in Phase 3.1-3.3
