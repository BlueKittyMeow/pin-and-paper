## Instructions for Gemini

Hey Gemini! This is your bug hunting document for Phase 3.4. Your job:

1. **Review the implementation plan** (`phase-3.4-implementation.md`)
2. **Look for edge cases** that Claude might have missed
3. **Test thoroughly** once implementation is complete
4. **Report bugs** using the format below
5. **Suggest improvements** for UX, performance, or code quality

**Your Strengths:**
- Fresh perspective
- Pattern recognition across similar features
- User empathy (what would frustrate a user?)
- Performance optimization ideas
