2. **Identify edge cases** and boundary conditions
3. **Validate test coverage** strategies
4. **Review code quality** during implementation
5. **Document findings** with clear explanations

**Your Strengths:**
- User experience analysis
- Edge case identification
- Test strategy validation
- Documentation clarity

## Planning Review

*Waiting for Gemini to review the Phase 3.5 implementation plan*

---

## Bug Reports

*No implementation yet - will update once code is written*

**Bug Report Template:**
```
## Issue: [Brief descriptive title]
**File:** path/to/file.dart:line-number
**Type:** [Bug / Performance / Architecture / Documentation]
**Found:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Description:**
[Clear explanation of what's wrong, including context and why it's a problem]

**Suggested Fix:**
[Specific recommendation with code examples if applicable]

**Impact:** [High / Medium / Low]
```

## Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions

*To be identified during plan review*

**Common patterns to check:**
- Empty states (no data, null values)
- Maximum limits (very long input, large lists)
- Concurrent operations (rapid taps, simultaneous edits)
- State transitions (loading → success → error)
- Network conditions (offline, slow connection)

---

## Test Strategy Review

*To be completed after test plan is created*

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Error conditions
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] State persistence
- [ ] User workflows

---

## UX Observations

*To be filled in by Gemini during implementation review*
