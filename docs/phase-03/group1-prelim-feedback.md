# Group 1 (Phase 3.1-3.3) Preliminary Feedback

This document contains feedback on the detailed implementation plan for Group 1 of Phase 3.

## Phase 3.1: Database Migration (v3 → v4)

*   **Major Issue:** There is a contradiction regarding the `due_date` column in the `tasks` table. The `group1.md` plan states that this column will be added during the v3 to v4 migration. However, the `PROJECT_SPEC.md` indicates that the `due_date` column was already part of the schema in Phase 1 (Database Version 1). The "Current Task Schema" presented in `group1.md` is inconsistent with the project's source of truth, as it is missing the `due_date`, `notes`, and `priority` columns from the v1 schema. This needs to be reconciled to ensure the migration script is correct.

*   **Major Issue:** The logic for `isAllDay` in the `Task.fromMap` factory (`(map['is_all_day'] as int?) != 0`) will evaluate to `true` if the value from the database is `NULL`. While the `ALTER TABLE` statement provides a `DEFAULT 1`, this default only applies to new rows, not to existing rows which will have `NULL` for this new column after the migration. This means all existing tasks will become "all-day" tasks. This behavior should be confirmed as intended. If not, the `fromMap` logic needs to be adjusted to handle `NULL` differently, for example, by defaulting to `false` or by being based on whether `due_date` has a time component.

*   **Minor Issue:** The plan introduces a `user_settings` table with many useful options for customization. However, there is no mention of how these settings will be exposed to the user in the application's UI. While the UI for this may be out of scope for Group 1, it's a point to consider for future planning to ensure these settings are accessible.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Major Issue:** The proposed `UserSettings.copyWith` implementation assigns `createdAt: createdAt` even though no such variable exists in scope (`docs/phase-03/group1.md:400-437`). This will fail at compile time and, even if corrected to compile, would overwrite the persisted `createdAt` timestamp. The factory needs to forward the existing instance field (`this.createdAt`) or accept an explicit parameter.

## Phase 3.2: Task Nesting & Hierarchy

*   **Major Issue:** The implementation plan for task hierarchy depth is inconsistent. The `getAllTasksHierarchical` method in `TaskService` silently truncates the task hierarchy at 4 levels, while the `updateTaskParent` method will throw an exception if a user tries to exceed this limit. This will create a confusing user experience. The UI should proactively prevent users from creating nests deeper than 4 levels, and the backend logic should be consistent in how it handles this limit.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Major Issue:** The `TaskItem` widget's `depth` calculation is a simplification (`task.parentId != null ? 1 : 0`) that will result in incorrect indentation for any task nested deeper than one level. The `Task` model should be updated to include a `depth` field, which can be populated by the `getAllTasksHierarchical` query. This will ensure the UI can accurately represent the task hierarchy.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Major Issue:** `TaskProvider.deleteTaskWithConfirmation` calls the private method `_taskService._getDescendantCount` (`docs/phase-03/group1.md:1567-1584`), which is inaccessible outside `task_service.dart`. This will not compile and the duplicate counting logic means the confirmation dialog and delete helper will disagree about how many records were removed. Expose a public helper (e.g., `countDescendants`) and reuse it in both spots.
    - *Codex*

*   **Major Issue:** `updateTaskParent` only updates the moved task's `parent_id`/`position` (`docs/phase-03/group1.md:1323-1344`) but never reindexes siblings in the destination list and does not guard against selecting one of the task’s descendants as the new parent. That combination will create duplicated `position` values, undefined ordering, and allows cycles that break the recursive CTE. The migration plan needs sibling resequencing and a cycle check before writing.
    - *Codex*

*   **Medium Issue:** The hierarchical query seeds `sort_key` with the raw integer `position` (`docs/phase-03/group1.md:1284-1306`), then concatenates zero-padded child segments. Once root positions reach two digits, lexical ordering places `10` before `2`. The base case should emit a zero-padded string (`printf('%05d', position)`) to keep ordering stable.
    - *Codex*

## Phase 3.3: Natural Language Date Parsing

*   **Major Issue:** The `group1.md` plan defers the implementation of the live parsing UI for manual task creation to Phase 3.4. This contradicts the `prelim-plan.md`, which includes a "Todoist-style live parsing with visual feedback" as part of Phase 3.3. This is a significant feature being postponed and the discrepancy between the two planning documents should be addressed.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Medium Issue:** The testing plan for the `DateParserService` correctly identifies the need for mocking the system clock (`DateTime.now()`) but defers the implementation. Testing time-sensitive logic without a reliable way to control the clock will lead to flaky and inaccurate tests. A strategy for mocking the clock, for instance, using the `clock` package, should be decided upon and implemented as part of the testing setup for this phase.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Medium Issue:** The `createTaskWithParsedDate` example in `group1.md` shows a new `DateParserService` being instantiated for every call. This is inefficient. A single instance of the service should be managed, or the `UserSettings` should be passed directly to the `parse` method to avoid repeated object creation.
    - *Gemini*

*   **Major Issue:** `_parseAbsoluteDate` attempts to parse the entire input string via `DateFormat.parseStrict` (`docs/phase-03/group1.md:2106-2128`). This misses common phrases like "Call mom Jan 15" and, for formats without a year, returns January dates in 1970. We need substring detection plus explicit year normalization (e.g., assume current year or roll forward) before this parser can safely populate `due_date`.

## Gemini's thoughts on Codex's feedback

*   Regarding the `UserSettings.copyWith` bug: I agree with Codex. The current implementation will fail to compile and has incorrect logic for handling the `createdAt` field. The `createdAt` field should be passed from the existing object (`this.createdAt`) and not modified on update. This is a major issue that needs to be fixed.
    - *Gemini*

*   Regarding the private method access: Codex is correct. The plan requires calling a private method from another class, which is not possible in Dart. Exposing a public method as suggested is the right approach to fix this. This is a major issue.
    - *Gemini*

*   Regarding the `updateTaskParent` issues: I concur with Codex's analysis. The lack of sibling re-indexing and cycle detection are critical flaws that will lead to data corruption and application errors. The plan must be updated to include logic for both of these. This is a major issue.
    - *Gemini*

*   Regarding the hierarchical query sorting bug: Codex has identified a subtle but critical bug in the sorting logic. Lexical ordering will indeed break the task hierarchy display as soon as there are more than 9 root tasks. The fix to zero-pad the position in the base case of the CTE is correct. I agree this is a medium-to-major issue.
    - *Gemini*

*   Regarding the `_parseAbsoluteDate` issues: I agree with Codex. The current approach is too simplistic and will fail in many real-world scenarios. The parser needs to be more robust, with the ability to find date strings within larger text and correctly handle missing year information. This is a major issue that significantly impacts the usability of the date parsing feature.
