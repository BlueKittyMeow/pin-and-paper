- Complete code examples
- Database schemas
- Testing strategies
- Success criteria
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### Available Phase Docs

## How to Use These Docs

1. **Read PROJECT_SPEC.md first** (in root directory) - Get the big picture
2. **Read the phase doc you're working on** - Get detailed implementation steps
3. **Refer to visual-design.md** (in root) - For aesthetic specifications
4. **Follow step-by-step** - Each phase builds on the previous

## Documentation Philosophy

These docs are **ultra-detailed** and **actionable**. They include:
- Complete code (copy-paste ready)
- Exact commands to run
- Expected outcomes
- How to verify success
- Troubleshooting tips

**Goal:** You should be able to implement each phase by following the doc line-by-line, with minimal guesswork.
