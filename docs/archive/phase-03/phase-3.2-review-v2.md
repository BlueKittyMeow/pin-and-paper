## Overall Assessment

The updated implementation plan (v2) is outstanding. It comprehensively addresses all feedback from the v1 review and provides a clear, detailed, and robust roadmap for the implementation of Phase 3.2.

The added specificity regarding the recursive CTE, drag-and-drop logic, validation methods, and testing scenarios significantly reduces ambiguity and implementation risk.
