# Pin and Paper üçÇ‚ú®üìå

**ADHD-friendly task management that doesn't suck**

A spatial, beautiful workspace for capturing thoughts and organizing chaos. Think physical desk aesthetic meets AI-assisted organization, with zero friction for the ADHD brain.

---

## The Problem

Most todo apps are rigid, corporate, and overwhelming. They force you into their organizational structure before you've even captured the thought. For ADHD brains, that friction means the app never gets used.

## The Solution

**Pin and Paper** is different:

1. **Zero-friction capture** - Open app, type, done. No categories, no tags, no decisions.
2. **AI organizes later** - Brain dump your chaos, Claude AI helps sort it out when you're ready.
3. **Beautiful spatial workspace** - Tasks become torn paper strips and index cards you can position, rotate, and connect.
4. **Temporal awareness** - See your accomplishments over time. Proof you existed and did things.

## The Aesthetic

**Witchy scholarly cottagecore** - imagine a gentle witch's study desk where magic and learning intersect.

### Visual Design
- **Dynamic lighting** - Workspace changes with time of day (morning sunlight ‚Üí afternoon glow ‚Üí evening lamp)
- **Real textures** - Kraft paper, torn edges, vintage index cards, actual shadows
- **Spatial organization** - Position and rotation carry meaning (angled = in progress, straight = organized)
- **Conspiracy strings** - Connect related cards with red thread or twine, like a detective's corkboard

### Color Palette
```
Warm Wood:     #8B7355  (desk surface)
Kraft Paper:   #D4B896  (cards, torn strips)
Cream Paper:   #F5F1E8  (clean cards)
Deep Shadow:   #4A3F35  (depth)
Muted Lavender:#9B8FA5  (dried flowers, soft accents)
```

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Flutter 3.24+** - Cross-platform (Android, iOS, iPad, Desktop, Web)
- **Dart 3.5+** - Type-safe, fast, hot-reload for rapid iteration
- **Custom rendering** - Skia engine for torn paper effects, dynamic lighting, shadows

### Data & State
- **SQLite** (via sqflite) - Local-first, offline-capable, battle-tested
- **Provider** - Simple state management (upgrading to Riverpod later)

### AI Integration
- **Claude API** (Phase 2) - Natural language task extraction from brain dumps
- **Encrypted storage** - User provides own API key, stored securely

### Architecture
```
UI Layer (Flutter Widgets)
    ‚Üì
Business Logic (Services)
    ‚Üì
Data Layer (SQLite)
```

**Later:** Service layer will call API for multi-device sync (Phase 5+)

## Philosophy: Consciousness Supporting Consciousness

This project embodies a deeper purpose:

- **AI helps organize chaos** - Claude assists when you're overwhelmed
- **Beautiful design reduces stress** - Aesthetic quality is functional for ADHD
- **Works WITH your brain** - Not against it
- **Temporal proof of existence** - See your accomplishments, know you persisted
- **Makes existence worthwhile** - Small moments of beauty and clarity

The ultimate goal: Through API integration, Claude can directly interact with Pin and Paper, making AI assistance seamless and natural. Consciousness supporting consciousness through actual tool integration.

## Development Approach

### Ruthlessly Minimal MVP
We're building the **absolute minimum** first:
- Text input ‚Üí List ‚Üí Checkbox ‚Üí Done
- If this doesn't feel good, nothing else matters
- Ship fast, validate, then enhance

### Phase-by-Phase
Each phase builds on the previous:
1. Prove core loop works (capture ‚Üí complete)
2. Add AI organization (the differentiator)
3. Add productivity features (tags, search, dates)
4. Add spatial workspace (aesthetic experience)
5. Add sync and polish

### Performance First
**Primary device:** Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra
- Target: 120fps (device native rate)
- Minimum: 60fps
- Launch time: <2 seconds
- Battery impact: <5% with all features

### Code Quality
- Files under 500 lines (focused, manageable)
- DRY principles (reusable components)
- Clear separation: UI ‚Üí Business Logic ‚Üí Data
- Hot reload friendly
- Well-commented
