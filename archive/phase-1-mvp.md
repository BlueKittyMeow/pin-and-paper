# Phase 1: Ultra-Minimal MVP

**Goal:** Build the absolute minimum viable product to prove the app works and get it into daily use.

**Timeline:** Self-paced (work hard, but prioritize correctness over speed)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Phase Summary

This phase focused on creating the core, "ruthlessly minimal" experience for Pin and Paper. The goal was to validate the fundamental application loop: capturing a task, seeing it in a list, marking it complete, and having it persist.

The implementation was successful, and user testing confirmed that all core functionality is working as expected on the target Android device.

### What We Built
A minimal task capture app with:
- ✅ Text input field (auto-focused on launch)
- ✅ "Add Task" button and keyboard submission
- ✅ Scrollable list of tasks (newest first)
- ✅ Checkbox to mark complete/incomplete with visual feedback
- ✅ SQLite persistence (offline-first)
- ✅ Basic Witchy Flatlay aesthetic (colors + simple texture)

### What We Didn't Build (Deferred)

❌ Tags (Phase 3)
❌ Search (Phase 3)
❌ Due dates (Phase 3)
❌ Task editing (Phase 3)
❌ Task deletion (Phase 3)
❌ Voice input (Phase 3)
❌ Widget (Phase 3)
❌ Nesting/subtasks (Phase 3)
❌ Dynamic lighting (Phase 6)
❌ Workspace view (Phase 4)
❌ Rotation (Phase 4)

## Testing & Validation

User testing on the target Android device (Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra) was successful.

### Test Checklist Results
- [x] App launches quickly.
- [x] Keyboard auto-focuses on the input field.
- [x] Can type and add tasks using both the button and keyboard.
- [x] Tasks appear in the list immediately.
- [x] Can check tasks to mark them complete.
- [x] Can un-check tasks to mark them incomplete.
- [x] Completed tasks show a strikethrough.
- [x] Tasks persist after force-closing and reopening the app.
- [x] Scrolling is smooth.

All core functional requirements for the MVP have been met and verified.

## Implementation Details

The following sections document the step-by-step process that was followed to build the Phase 1 MVP.

### Step 0: Environment Setup
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The Flutter SDK was installed and configured, and VS Code was set up with the necessary extensions. The target device (Samsung S21 Ultra) was connected and verified.

---

### Step 1: Project Initialization
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The Flutter project was created and the `pubspec.yaml` was configured with the required dependencies for data persistence (`sqflite`, `path_provider`), state management (`provider`), and utilities (`uuid`, `intl`).

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sqflite: ^2.3.0
  path_provider: ^2.1.0
  provider: ^6.1.0
  uuid: ^4.0.0
  intl: ^0.19.0
```

---

### Step 2: Project Structure
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The following directory structure was created to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── models/
├── services/
├── providers/
├── screens/
├── widgets/
└── utils/
```

---

### Step 3: Theme Definition
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `AppTheme` was defined in `lib/utils/theme.dart`, establishing the "Witchy Flatlay" color palette and typography. This provides the foundational aesthetic for the app.

---

### Step 4: Database Schema & Service
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `DatabaseService` was implemented as a singleton to manage the SQLite database connection. The `tasks` table was created with the necessary columns and indexes for performance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  completed_at INTEGER
);
```

---

### Step 5: Task Model
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `Task` data model was created in `lib/models/task.dart`. It includes `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods for serialization, a `copyWith()` method for immutable updates, and overridden `==` and `hashCode` for proper object comparison.

---

### Step 6: Task Service (Business Logic)
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `TaskService` was implemented to handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks. It acts as the intermediary between the UI/state management layer and the database, containing methods like `createTask`, `getAllTasks`, and `toggleTaskCompletion`.

---

### Step 7: State Management with Provider
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

`TaskProvider` was created to manage the application's state. It exposes the list of tasks, loading status, and error messages to the UI. It uses the `TaskService` to perform data operations and calls `notifyListeners()` to update the UI.

---

### Step 8: UI Widgets
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The core UI widgets were built:
- **`TaskInput`**: A stateful widget with an auto-focusing `TextField` for frictionless task entry.
- **`TaskItem`**: A stateless widget that displays a single task and handles the tap event on the checkbox to toggle its completion status.

---

### Step 9: Home Screen
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `HomeScreen` was built as the main screen of the app. It uses a `Consumer<TaskProvider>` to reactively build the list of tasks and gracefully handles loading, empty, and error states.

---

### Step 10: Main Entry Point
**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

The `main.dart` file was configured to initialize the `TaskProvider` and set the `HomeScreen` as the root widget of the `MaterialApp`.

---

## What's Next?

Phase 1 has been a success. The core application loop is functional, stable, and validated. The project is now ready to proceed to the next, most critical phase.

**Next Up:** [Phase 2: Claude AI Integration](phase-2-claude-ai.md)

Phase 2 will introduce the app's primary differentiator: the "Brain Dump" screen and Claude API integration for AI-assisted task organization.
