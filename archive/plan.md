## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Skeuomorphic aesthetic** - Real-world textures and objects
- **Tactile feeling** - Should feel like touching paper, moving physical objects
- **Beautiful first** - Design isn't decoration, it's core to the experience
- **User customization** - No single aesthetic fits everyone
- **Attention to detail** - Shadows, lighting, texture all matter

### Interaction Design
- **Zero friction capture** - Adding a task should be effortless
- **Spatial intelligence** - Position and proximity carry meaning
- **Forgiving** - Easy to undo, move, reorganize
- **Discoverable** - Features revealed progressively, not overwhelming
- **Fast** - No loading spinners, instant feedback
- **Touch-optimized** - Big enough tap targets, good gestures

### Information Architecture
- **Flat when needed** - Text-only view for speed
- **Infinite depth when wanted** - Nest as deep as needed
- **Multiple views** - List, workspace, journal - same data, different lenses
- **Tags not categories** - Fluid, overlapping organization
- **Temporal awareness** - See your productivity over time
